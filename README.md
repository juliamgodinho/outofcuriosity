# outofcuriosity
new repository for all things curious

I work at the Wellcome Trust in London where I am training to become a Scrum Master. I previously worked as a Product Manager in Munich where we developed software for corporate and public carsharing. This repository will be used to document my way around all things tech and will hopefully help me to develop a working relationship with GitHub!
